# 🚀 ToolNest Frontend

ToolNest is a private, PIN-secured personal dashboard built with Next.js and Firebase. Track your expenses, todos, stock earnings, schedules, and more — all in one modular, scalable workspace. 

ToolNest's frontend is built using **Next.js** — a powerful fullstack React framework — to deliver a fast, scalable, and dynamic experience. This app connects with the ToolNest Django backend and handles all UI, user interaction, and client-side logic.
